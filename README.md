## Problem Statement 
The vehicle density on the roads are increasing every year
-More peak hour traffic
-More time spent on the roads
-Extra maintenance costs for road management- Infrastructure costs, etc.

Owning a vehicle in the city is not all that profitable
-Increase in ‘bad’ debt on automobiles – EMIs, Loans, etc.
-Maintenance costs. -Insurance costs, Service etc.
-Parking place issues.



## Solution
An integrated software application that allows the enterprises to handle the transportation within a city by enabling users to rent cars
The idea is to build a system which encourages people to share their cars and other vehicles by getting rewards in return.
